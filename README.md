# url-shortner
A application like bitly, given a long url; it returns a shorter one!
Hello!

Here are some features:
- Paste a valid url inside the given textfield, 
 - ex : https://google.com is valid, but google.com is invalid!
- Receive a redirection URL which will take you to the given site!

Here are some updates for the future (aka if I had more time):
- React memoization in order to increase efficiency.

To run the challenge:

- FORK this repo
- Download forked repo and run `npm install && npm run dev`
- Open `localhost:3000` in your browser
- Change MongoDB config in server/config/db.config.js to your own mongodb atlas. 
- Enjoy!
